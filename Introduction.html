            <h1 class="text-center my-4">Welcome to my lessons on PowerShell</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Ava and I once upon a time like you had decided to learn PowerShell. At the time I already
                had some experience with Java and Python and was familiar with many commandline tools from working in
                IT. When I was learning PowerShell, I found myself more or less Googling how I would do something I already
                knew how to do in other lanugages or in cmd.exe, but with PowerShell. In the beginning, I thought it would 
                be a way to make managing a large number of desktop computers simultaneously easy and really only wanted to 
                learn enough to achieve my goals. Eventually, I started looking at PowerShell as a way to unify all of the
                administrative tools I used in Windows under one administrative tool. Even better than that, it provided
                a higher level of granularity in most cases than what you would be able to see through the GUI.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Who this is for:</h2>
            <p>
                I have three target audience members in mind as I am writing this. The first are developers or people
                who already know a programming language who would otherwise be Googling questions like "does PowerShell allow 
                function overloading?" The second are administrators who come from a *nix background and may already be
                comfortable with Bash and Python. The last group that I am writing this for are Windows admins who are pretty
                comfortable using the commandline and who can create batch scripts, but may not have a programming background.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're not in one of these groups, you may still find some value here. I'm going to have examples that are
                derivations of things I have actually used in the real world that made my bosses pleased. In many cases, you
                can take these examples as starting points and hack them into something that will work for you. That won't
                necessarily benefit you as much in the long run as actually learning why this stuff works the way it does,
                but it is a way to get started using PowerShell.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-3">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                My teaching philosophy is to keep things short and to 
the point. Humans are hardly super-computers and the average person
                can only stay focused for about 20 minutes at a time. I 
have tried to break these lessons up into bite-sized portions.
                Rather than try to cover every single detail there is to
 know about one particular topic, I am going to give you enough
                to get started using it right away. I am going to come 
back to certain topics later on and provide additional details
                rather than give it to you all at once. I often will 
introduce a term by using it in context with minimal definition
                only to deep-dive into it at a later point.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason I have designed these lessons this way is 
because this is the way I actually learned programming. I would hear
                a term or see a code snippet that was an example of a 
concept and learn just enough to use it to solve a problem. Eventually
                I would realize I understood how to use things, but not 
why I used them that way and would start to investigate further.
                Some people seem able to just pick up a book on 
programming and start reading it chapter by chapter with each covering a
                topic in great detail. If you're one of those people, 
this book may seem a bit circular to you.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-3">What am I going to get out of this?</h2>
            <p>
                By the end of this course, you should have an 
understanding of how to use PowerShell to do many tasks you would 
encounter
                as a helpdesk technician or Windows SysAdmin. Not only 
this, but I will be showing you on way you can "manage herds, not 
                pets" with tools that are freely included with Windows. 
You will also have been exposed to all of the material you would
                encounter in a 101 level introduction to programming 
course, except from the perspective of using PowerShell. This is
                something I haven't seen many other places - most seem 
to focus on scripting or using the shell.
