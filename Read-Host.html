                This is the first lesson in a series of lessons on making your code more reusable.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Before you begin: </h2>
            <p>
                In this lesson, we will be using PowerShell files you can find in the following github repo in a folder named 
                PowerShell_Functions:
                <a href="https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell">https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell</a>.
                If you have never used Github before, for full instructions on how to download this file, please see my page on 
                <a href="./Getting_Started.html">Getting Started</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">The problem</h2>
            <p>
                In the examples I have gone over so far, I have had hard
 coded values in my scripts. This works okay, but you'll 
                have to edit the file any time you want to pass in 
different values. Also, if you have to do this frequently, it 
                might lead to you keeping multiple copies of a script. 
This is not the best design for a few reasons. It is time 
                consuming to maintain a fleet of scripts, first and 
foremost, but it also can lead to user error. Using file names 
                to encode this information can get confusing and it's 
very easy to run the wrong script if you hide the details of 
                the script away.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Read-Host</h2>
            <p>
                There is a cmdlet named Read-Host which can be used to 
get information for the shell. This is one approach to making 
                a script interactive and therefore reusable for a number
 of situations. When Read-Host is executed, PowerShell will pause
                and wait for you to type some input then press the 
Return key. The input can be stored in a variable as a string.
            </p>
            <p>
                This cmdlet is usually the first way someone who is 
moving to PowerShell from cmd.exe will try to approach this problem.
                It will work, but can make your code a bit crowded and 
cumbersome if used too much. It's also not the most self-documenting 
                code and hides away some of the details from other 
programmers. In my opinion, a better approach is to use parameters. 
There
                is one exception to this and that is when handling 
passwords.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Stdout, Stdin, Stderr</h2>
            <p>
                I have been trying to keep this material fairly light so
 far. I have been peppering in some high-level ideas, but I have been
                avoiding going in to great detail when I do. It would be
 impossible to call lessons on any shell language complete without 
mentioning
                stdout, stdin, and stderr.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are our standard streams. I hope that if you're 
reading this far that you already know this, but if somehow you do not, 
computers
                are machines that take inputs, process them in some way,
 then output the results. Standard streams are the communication 
channels for
                inputs (stdin), outputs (stdout), and errors (stderr). 
Errors technically are an output stream, but one dedicated for error 
messages
                and diagnostics.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Streams</h5>
            <p>
                Most resources that cover standard streams never 
actually tell you what a stream is. Streams differ from files in that 
they are potentially
                endless. Think about a radio broadcast. The radio 
station is constantly generating new content to broadcast. It is a 
potentially endless
                source of data being streamed to us. We call this codata
 whereas files deal with data. Here's a fun article on the history of 
the Unix
                command grep. <a href="https://thenewstack.io/brian-kernighan-remembers-the-origins-of-grep/">https://thenewstack.io/brian-kernighan-remembers-the-origins-of-grep/</a>
                tl;dr - Back in the day, resource limitations would force researchers to treat large files as streams.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 1</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Read-Host_files/ReadHost-Example1.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                This example is incredibly short - just two lines! The 
first prompts the user (stdin) to enter their name and stores the result
 in the
                variable $MyNameIs. The second writes the output to the 
console window (stdout).
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Read-Host_files/ReadHost-Example1-Result.png"><br>
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 2</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Read-Host_files/ReadHost-Example2.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Here, we're using the -AsSecureString switch to tell 
PowerShell we want it to store our input as a SecureString object. This 
object
                will let you use passwords in your PowerShell scripts 
interactively in a secure way. This is one of the few times the 
Read-Host cmdlet
                really is your best option. This script will set the 
password for your built-in administrator account. This is something you 
really
                should set if you haven't already, so I recommend going 
ahead and doing this. You will have to run this script as a member of 
the
                administrators group.
