                This is the second code example in a series of lessons 
on making your code more reusable. If you have been following along, you
 now
                have enough knowledge to start building tools that will 
solve real world problems. I am going to walk you through developing a 
script
                to demonstrate how to apply the concepts from the 
previous lesson.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Before you begin: </h2>
            <p>
                In this lesson, we will be using PowerShell files you can find in the following github repo in a folder named 
                PowerShell_Functions:
                <a href="https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell">https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell</a>.
                If you have never used Github before, for full instructions on how to download this file, please see my page on 
                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/PowerShell/1">Getting Started</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Developing a script</h2>
            <p>
                This is part 2 of a series of lessons where we develop a
 script to print pdf files in alphabetical order in a target directory. 
So far,
                we have taken this script and used the Read-Host command
 to extend its functionality to multiple situations. We are going to 
take
                what we started there and develop it further using what 
we now know about positional parameters.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Where we left off</h2>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="SitStayCreate%20-%20Print-Files2_files/Print-FilesRH.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                We have a script where we are now accepting user input 
via the Read-Host cmdlet. This is a definite improvement over the 
initial
                script with hardcoded values, but I think we can still 
make it better. Imagine you have run this script several hundred times.
                You have now had to read the prompt from the Read-Host 
command two times that amount. One of the reasons to write scripts is to
                make repetive things less tedious. It would be nice if 
we used positional parameters so that we can provide the values when we
                call the script and bypass the Read-Host cmdlet.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Positional Parameters</h2>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="SitStayCreate%20-%20Print-Files2_files/Print-FilesPP.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                I have made some significant changes to the script in 
this iteration. First, I am using two positional parameters to set the 
values
                of the variables $ParentDirectory and $FileExt. Next, I 
have an if statement that tests to see if a value was provided for the 
first
                positional parameter. If it is not, I am using the 
Read-Host cmdlet to get the input from the user. I don't really like 
prompting
                for user input using the -prompt parameter. The 
Write-Host cmdlet provides more flexibility and additional features. You
 can use
                Write-Host followed by Read-Host to let the user know 
what kind of input you are asking for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following this, I have a while statement which executes 
as long as $FileExt will evaulate to false. My reasoning here is that 
under
                normal circumstances, pretty much any printable file 
will have a file extension. If you would like to print files without 
file extensions,
                you can do this using the * wildcard, but you will end 
up printing all files in a directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything outside of this is exactly as it was in part 
1. The error handling here is a little bit gratuitous, but I created it 
specfically
                to demonstrate the strength of named parameters. When we
 return in part 3, we will be refactoring this script using named 
parameters.
