                This is the first code example in a series of lessons on
 making your code more reusable. If you have been following along, you 
now
                have enough knowledge to start building tools that will 
solve real world problems. I am going to walk you through developing a 
script
                to demonstrate how to apply the concepts from the 
previous lesson.

                In this lesson, we will be using PowerShell files you can find in the following github repo in a folder named 
                PowerShell_Functions:
                <a href="https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell">https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell</a>.
                If you have never used Github before, for full instructions on how to download this file, please see my page on 
                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/PowerShell/1">Getting Started</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Developing a script</h2>
            <p>
                I have a friend who was trying to write a script with 
VBScript that would allow him to print files in a folder in alphebetical
 order.
                He needed it to be finished in 24 hours and was unable 
to get it to work. I told him I could do it, but would prefer to do it 
in
                PowerShell. Since I was starting from scratch and only 
had a small timeframe to create something that worked, and also had the 
added
                challenge of not actually owning a printer, I hacked 
together the following:
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="SitStayCreate%20-%20Print-Files1_files/Print-PdfFiles.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                This is a fully functional script that prints all the 
files in a specific directory with the extension pdf. It relies on two 
conditions:
                1) Adobe Reader is your default pdf application (others 
might work but are untested) and 2) your default printer is not a pdf 
printer or
                other print-to-file printer.
            </p>
            <p>
                This first obvious improvement we can do to this script 
is to allow us to change the target directory. My friend had suggested 
that having
                it print files in the same directory the script is in 
would be a nice feature. He also was quick to point out the obvious 
trade-off would be
                that you would have to copy the script to that location 
first. I think it's a good idea, but that we should also allow the 
script to accept
                user input to change the path when it is running. We can
 achieve this with the Read-Host cmdlet.
            </p>
            <p>
                A second, maybe less obvious improvement is that we 
might be able to use this script with different file types. We're using 
the start-process
                cmdlet and all I've tested is that it works with pdf 
files when Adobe Reader is your default pdf application. This script 
might work with other
                file extensions and other applications without 
modification and it would be cool if other people could figure that out 
as they needed to. We
                can also make this happen with the Read-Host cmdlet to 
accept user input for this parameter.
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="SitStayCreate%20-%20Print-Files1_files/Print-FilesRH.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Using the Read-Host cmdlet to accept the file path 
actually works with relative paths as well as with absolute paths. I 
didn't expect this to
                be the case, but it's very serendipitous and the kind of
 thing that makes PowerShell fun to work with for small routine tasks.
