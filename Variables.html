               So far we've explored a decent amount of territory. Before we move forward I want to recap in case some readers
               haven't been following along in order (I almost never learn things sequentially unless I force myself, so kudos 
               to you for being human). We've learned about data types, we've looked at arithmetic operators and comparison
               operators. We've also had some practice in the shell and discussed what PowerShell is at a high level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even with all we have covered so far, at this point we still can't really do much with PowerShell. You will be
                able to use it as a glorified calculator, but not much else. Things are going to become much more interesting
                now as we begin to cover variables, control flow, and functions.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">What is a variable?</h2>
            <p>
                If you've ever learned algebra you may have an idea of 
what a mathematical variable is. It is more or less a letter that
                is used to represent an unknown number or perhaps, more 
along the lines of what we will be doing, the input to a function.
            </p>
            <p> 
                When I was first learning programming, someone explained
 to me that a variable is kind of like a container that stores a 
                value. This is actually a pretty inaccurate description,
 but I think it's probably helpful to conceptualize the idea for 
                a beginner. In the programming languages I have 
encountered, a variable is more like a ticket for a coat check. It 
doesn't 
                actually contain the coat, it just has a reference to 
the coat which can be used to get the coat when you need to.
            </p>

            <p>
                What is the syntax for a variable in PowerShell? 
Variables begin with a dollar sign ($) as in $Var. The second character 
may 
                be a char or an int, however, some special characters 
are not allowed, for instance $` or $~.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Assignment Operators</h5>
            <p>
                To "store" a value in a variable, we use the equals sign
 (=). This a different kind of operator than we have seen before; it is
                called an assignment operator. We use these kinds of 
operators to assign a value to a variable. The syntax for assigning a 
value
                to a variable is the variable name, followed by an equal
 sign, followed by the data you would like to assign to the variable.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Initializing and assigning a variable</h5>
            <p>
                What is initiliazing and assigning a variable? In 
programming languages there are two parts to using a variable. The first
 is
                initialization, or the act of creating the variable. The
 second is assignment, or assigning a value to that variable. In other
                languages it is possible to do these at the same time or
 at different times. With PowerShell you are able to initialize and 
                assign a variable at different times or at the same 
time. However, using uninitialized variables can lead to unintended 
consequences 
                <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/avoid-powershell-errors-by-initializing-variables/">(see Dr Scripto's blog post)</a>
                and I think actually would be pretty hard to do when you're first starting out.

            <!-- type accelerators and dynamic typing-->
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Revisiting types</h2>
            <p>
                One of the defining characterisics of a programming 
language is whether or not it is strongly typed or weakly typed. What 
                this means is whether or not data of a certain type be 
coerced into a different type of data in a language. Some languages, 
                like Python and Java, are strongly typed. Other 
languages, like Javascript are weakly typed. Normally, PowerShell 
behaves 
                as a weakly typed language. In the example below, we 
create a variable named $WeakInt and store the value 5 in it. When we
                call .getType() on this variable, we see that it is an 
Int32. We can then take this variable and assign a string to it.
                PowerShell decided in this context it makes the most 
sense to treat the integer as a string and so it automatically becomes 
                a string. If this were a strongly typed language, the 
variable would only be able to store data of the type int32.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Weakly typed variables</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./images/PoshVars/PoshVars-WeaklyTyped.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                There are some cases in which PowerShell will treat 
variables as strongly typed instead of weakly typed. When we use type 
                accelerators to declare a variable or to typecast a 
variable in PowerShell, that variable becomes strongly typed. In the
                example below, we recreate our first example, except 
this time when we initiliaze the variable $StrongInt, we use the type
                accelerator [int]. Now when we try to assign a string to
 this variable, PowerShell throws an error.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Strongly typed variables</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./images/PoshVars/PoshVars-StronglyTyped.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                In creating the example here, I played around with this 
feature a bit to see if there were any limitations or caveats. One
                thing that initially threw me for a loop is that under 
some conditions, PowerShell appears to have converted the type of
                the data when it was created with a type accelerator. 
Consider you have a variable of type string storing the character "5".
                You created this variable with the type accelerator 
[string]. What happens when we feed this as the second argument to the
                addition operator? Do you think it will return 10? It in
 fact does. In this particular instance, I believe PowerShell is
                creating a new integer and using this in place of the 
string before adding the values. While this would be easy to test,
                it's unimportant for our purposes. This is an example of
 how PowerShell can keep you on your toes. Sometimes you will
                encounter things that will give you pause or maybe not 
work the way you think they should. Keep this in mind as you
                attempt to learn new things or develop your own scripts.
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./images/PoshVars/PoshVars-TypeAcceleratorGotcha.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Some people think it is a good practice, maybe best 
practice, to always use type accelerators in your PowerShell projects.
                You can do this and it will be beneficial if you are 
working on a team with multiple people maintaining the same projects,
                modules, or scripts. It is nice to know how someone else
 intended a variable to be used when they created it and also to
                be reasonably certain that there are no bugs lurking 
because a piece of data was converted from one type to another. I
                very much loved this feature when I first learned 
PowerShell because it was a scripting language that supported strongly
                typed variables and I was coming from a Java background.
 As I have gained more experience with PowerShell, I rely less
                heavily on this feature and more heavily on explicitly 
named variables. If something is a string, I usually use the word
                string in the name, as in $CoolString. If it was an 
int32, I would probably call it $CoolInt. You can use whichever approach
                you like and I personally think both approaches are 
appropriate for different situations and really are a matter of taste.
