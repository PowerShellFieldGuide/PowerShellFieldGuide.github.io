                This is the first lesson in a series of lessons on making your code more reusable.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Before you begin: </h2>
            <p>
                In this lesson, we will be using PowerShell files you can find in the following github repo in a folder named 
                PowerShell_Collections:
                <a href="https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell">https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell</a>.
                If you have never used Github before, for full instructions on how to download this file, please see my page on 
                <a href="./Introduction.html">Getting Started</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">What is a function?</h2>
            <p>
                Much like variables, if you've ever learned algebra you 
may have an idea of what a mathematical function is. According
                to <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Function.html">Wolfram:</a>
 "A function is a relation that uniquely 
                associates members of one set with members of another 
set." I think a reasonable translation of that is a function 
                takes a set of inputs and produces a set of outputs 
where each input is associated with only one output. You may 
                remember F(x)=mx+b as the slope-intercept form of a 
linear function. When you input a number into x, you would always 
                get the same result or output. Functions work the same 
way in programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                Functions are another way to make your code reusable. 
You can wrap a portion of PowerShell code inside of a function. 
                You can then use this code anywhere in your script by 
using the function name. This is called calling the function. I 
                think I've used some of this terminology before now, but
 I don't think I had provided a formal definition yet.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Syntax</h2>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Functions_files/Functions-Syntax.png"><br>
            </div>
            <!-- TODO: Syntax and Alternative syntax images -->
            <p>
                Functions at a minimum consist of the function keyword, 
the name of the function, and curly braces surrounding the statements
                PowerShell will execute when the function is called. 
PowerShell functions can also accept positional parameters and named
                parameters. PowerShell functions support two different 
syntaxes for parameters. The first, recommend syntax is to use the
                param statement. The alternative syntax is similar to 
other programming languages - you define the parameters before the first
                curly brace. I have never seen this syntax outside of 
Microsoft's documentation and do not use it myself.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Return Keyword</h2>
            <p>
                In PowerShell, the return keyword exits a function, 
script, or script block. Unlike break statements, the return keyword
                will return a specific value if followed by a value or 
an expression. We use the return keyword with functions to use the 
output
                of a function in some way in our script. If this seems a
 bit abstract, I think it will make more sense once I cover some 
examples.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 1</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Functions_files/Functions-Example1.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                In our first example, we create a HelloUser function. 
This is kind of a variation on a hello world app. The function is 
defined on 
                lines 1-8. Note that we start with the Function keyword,
 followed by the name of the function, then two curly braces. This 
function 
                accepts two parameters, one named $FistName and one 
named $LastName. These are not required parameters, so the function can 
be called
                with or without them. We call the function on line 10 
and pass in the arguments "John" and "Doe" for our parameters. We can 
run this
                script in the PowerShell console and see "Hello John 
Doe!" written to the console window.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Functions_files/Functions-Example1-Result.png"><br>
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 2</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Functions_files/Functions-Example2.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Next we have an example that demonstrates using the 
Return statement. Here we get the timezone of our computer with the 
cmdlet 
                Get-TimeZone and store the output in a variable named 
$Timezone. We then return the variable $Timezone on line 5. When we call
                our function, it executes the code, then returns the 
value stored in $Timezone.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Functions_files/Functions-Example2-Result.png"><br>
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 3</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Functions_files/Functions-Example3.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                In example three, we have three variables, $Timezone, 
$String, and $Int. Our function ends with three lines of code where we 
have just
                these variables. What do you think will happen? If 
you're coming from another programming language you may be surprised to 
learn PowerShell
                returns all three values as elements of an object array.
 On line 12 we assign the output of the NoReturnStatement() function to a
 variable
                named $ReturnedValues. Calling .getType() and displaying
 the $ReturnedValues array's elements in the console shows the 
surprising behavior.
            </p>
            <p>            
                This is the absolute worst part of PowerShell if I'm 
being honest. Advanced functions actually are worse, but classes are a 
great workaround
                and are simpler. It turns out classes are also simpler 
than regular functions which should be as maddening to you as it is to 
me. This is
                another one of those shell vs. script tradeoffs and 
after a lot of thought I can appreciate why it exists, but it never gets
 less annoying.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Functions_files/Functions-Example3-Result.png"><br>
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 4</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Functions_files/Functions-Example4.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                If you were holding out hope that the Return statement 
would fix this nonsense, you're wrong. The above code still returns an 
object
                array with three elements. There are really only two 
ways to deal with this problem. The first is to learn OOP and use 
classes since
                they don't behave this way. The second is to be 
incredibly mindful of what you're doing while you're writing your 
scripts. You should
                really do both; the first when appropriate and the 
second always.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Functions_files/Functions-Example4-Result.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                I wanted to end this lesson with a warning. Don't go 
overboard with functions, especially if you use Java or some other 
                compiled language. Wrapping your code in functions isn't
 necessary and using unnecessary things isn't a best practice. 
                I'm guilty of doing this early in my career and if you 
want to create PowerShell modules, then yes, you'll want to wrap 
                everything in a function, but there's a specific way to 
do this and it doesn't involve putting a function named Main() in 
                all of your scripts.
