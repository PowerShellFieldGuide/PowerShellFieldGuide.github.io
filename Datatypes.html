            <p>
                In writing this lesson, I reached out to some of my programmer friends from different disciplines.
                I was trying to figure out how to explain this topic to my intended audience and to do it in a way
                that doesn't feel too abstract. I realized that I learned what a data type was by context clues well
                before I ever read a formal definition. By the time I actually did read a definition, I already knew
                the most commonly used data types and how a few languages handled them differently. I don't think I
                fully understood how necessary they were until I tried using VBScript or Tcl for the first time. Writing
                unattended, mission-critical scripts with sufficient error-handling in a language that only provides
                you with strings is a lot harder than you might think. My friends I reached out to had similar experiences
                unless they were computer science majors.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm still not sure I have a great way to explain this concept without talking around it in addition to
                providing a definition, so this is going to be the way I try to approach this topic. So what is the point
                of data types and why do they matter? Data types tell a computer what kind of data some data is and what
                to do with that data. This will make more sense once we cover a few data types.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Common data types</h2>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">

            </div>  
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Characters and Strings</h5>
            <p>
                As I alluded to before, some older scripting languages only had one data type and that was a string.
                Strings are pretty easy to understand - they are a collection of characters. Characters themselves
                are a datatype, and they are individual letters. I wanted to start with strings and characters because
                they illustrate an important concept - some data types are created out of other, more basic data types.
                These basic data types are often called primitives in many programming languages. They are the most 
                fundamental building blocks from which everything else is created. I couldn't really find any documentation 
                on this in PowerShell, but I was able to deduce the information from looking at the C# documentation and 
                playing around in the PowerShell console. In C#, primitives are called built-in types. There are two main 
                types - built-in types and reference types. Strings are a reference type and characters are a built-in type.
                Since PowerShell and C# both use classes from the .Net framework, most things work similarly or the same in
                both.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Mathematical data types</h5>
            <p>
                In addition to strings and chars, we also have mathematical data types, such as integers, floats, and doubles.
                These, like chars, are built-in types. Integers are positive or negative whole numbers. Floats and doubles both 
                represent rational numbers, but with different levels of precision. Doubles are more precise than floats, but 
                also require more memory.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Booleans</h5>
            <p>
                There are also boolean data types, or True and False. In addition to keywords, these types usually can also be 
                represented as 0 or 1 with 0 being false and 1 being true. Booleans are also built-in types in C#.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Null</h5>
            <p>
                Before we get to the last data type, I wanted to mention
 that this is not a comprehensive list of built-in types.
                These types live in the System namespace in the .Net 
framework and you can find them here:
                <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/built-in-types</a>
                Now, with that in mind, the last data type we have is 
null. Null represents the absence of a value. A fun bit
                of programming history is that the person who invented 
them later referred to null as his "billion dollar mistake."

            <h2 class="text-center my-4">PowerShell Type Accelators</h2>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./images/PoshDataTypes/String-Example1.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                At this point, we sure have spent a lot of time talking 
about C# and other scripting languages for a PowerShell
                lesson. Now, let's talk about how they work in 
PowerShell and how you can make them work to your advantage.
                Open a PowerShell console. Type "this is a string" and 
hit enter. Congratulations, you made a string. We can call
                a method named .getType() on this text and see that it 
is in fact a string.
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./images/PoshDataTypes/Bool-Example1.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Let's try this again with a boolean. In PowerShell, the 
syntax for true is $true. Call .getType() on $true and
                you can see that it is in fact a boolean. This seems 
really simple and straight forward, so let's try a couple
                examples that maybe don't work out the way you think 
they would. Try calling .getType() on the integer 5 and also
                on the letter "c". Make sure to not use the quotes 
around 5 so that it is an integer and not a string. Notice that
                the letter "c" is a string and not a char and that we 
can't call .getType() on 5. 
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./images/PoshDataTypes/IntChar-Example1.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                We're going to get a little bit ahead of ourselves here since we will be covering variables in a later chapter,
                but I think you'll be able to intuitively understand this. We are able to call .getType() on the integer 5 by
                storing it in a variable first. Variables start with a $ in PowerShell. We store 5 in a variable named $Spam
                and call .getType() on this variable. When we get the result we see it's actually of the type int32. This is
                a 32 bit signed integer to be accurate, but I don't want to get bogged down in details.
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./images/PoshDataTypes/Int-Example2.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                I mentioned before that PowerShell and C#'s built in 
                data types come from the .Net framework. I also said that
                they live in the System namespace. We can access these
                in PowerShell with aliases called type accelerators so
                that we don't have to provide the namespace. The syntax 
                for a type accelerator is to place the name of the type
                inside of square brackets. We can use [int] for int32, 
                [string] for strings, [bool] for booleans, [float] for floats,
                [double] for doubles, and [char] for chars. Think back 
                to when we tried to create a char before and it automatically
                became a string. Assign the string "c" to a variable 
                named $Char, but this time place the type accelerator [char]
                before the variable. Call .getType() on this variable 
                and this time it is a character.
            </p>

                I have covered only a few of the available type accelerators in PowerShell. You can find a complete list here:
