                In this lesson, we are going to cover PowerShell Lists.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Before you begin: </h2>
            <p>
                In this lesson, we will be using PowerShell files you can find in the following github repo in a folder named 
                PowerShell_Collections:
                <a href="https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell">https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell</a>.
                If you have never used Github before, for full instructions on how to download this file, please see my page on 
                <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000/PowerShell/1">Getting Started</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">What is a list?</h2>
            <p>
                What is a list? A list is similar to an array in that it
 is a collection of items. The syntax for accessing list elements is 
even 
                the same as the syntax for accessing array elements. 
There are some very important differences between arrays and lists.
            </p>
            <p> 
                In the lesson on arrays, I told you that arrays are 
quick to access elements, but slow to add new elements or remove 
elements. 
                I said that this was because arrays are immutable. I 
want to explore that idea a little bit further before I explain how 
lists 
                are different. When we create an array in PowerShell, 
PowerShell reserves some memory addresses for the array. These memory 
                addresses have to be adjacent for this data structure. 
In order to increase the size of the array, our computer has to find 
more 
                adjacent memory addresses that can accomodate the larger
 array size. The computer then copies the values from the old array to 
the 
                new array and assigns the new value to the new element.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is why arrays are not a very good data structure to
 use if you need to insert new elements, add new elements, or remove 
elements.
                You can reserve extra memory for an array as a work 
around, but then you're just reserving that memory and you may not even 
need it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that you know what's really going on when you create
 an array, I think it will be easy to understand the list data 
structure. The 
                list data structure is not of a fixed sized, i.e. is 
mutable. The way this works is that the list does not require adjacent 
memory 
                addresses; each list element stores a reference to the 
preceding element in the set and a reference to the following element in
 the set.
                This means that inserting elements into a list, adding 
elements into a list, and removing elements from a list requires fewer 
resources 
                than the same changes do with arrays. Here all that has 
to happen is to create a new space somewhere in memory for the new item 
and to 
                update the references to reflect the changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The trade-off we have with lists is that we lose the 
ability to access any element in the collection immediately. In order to
 find a 
                specific element, we have to go sequentially in order 
checking the references until we find our element. Because of this, 
lists have 
                worse performance than arrays when looking up an 
element's value. In computer science, this property of arrays is called 
"random access."
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 1</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="SitStayCreate%20-%20Lists_files/Lists-Example1.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                On line 1, we create an instance of a list and assign it
 to $ObjectList. The syntax here might look a bit thorny, but really 
we're just 
                telling what part of the .Net framework to look in with 
the first part (System.Collections.Generic namespace). If you ignore 
this part,
                it might look a bit less intimidating. We simply have 
the datatype List[object] in the type accelerator and we are creating a 
new instance 
                <!-- TODO: is this called the new operator? --> by calling the static new method on the class. Also, please note that we do not specify 
                how big it is when we create it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next we add elements to our list with the .add() method.
 We create a List[object] which means that the list will accept any data
 type 
                that is a subclass of the object type. This allows us to
 add different data types to our list. To illustrate this, we add a 
string first,
                then three int32s. Following this, we call .getType() on
 the list and all of it's elements. Lastly, we return the $ObjectList 
and display 
                the values of the elements. See the output below, and 
note that the first element is in fact a string while the rest are 
int32s.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="SitStayCreate%20-%20Lists_files/Lists-Example1-Result.png"><br>
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 2</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="SitStayCreate%20-%20Lists_files/Lists-Example2.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                The next example is pretty much the same as the first, 
but here we specify that the list can only store strings. Instead of 
creating 
                a List[object], we create a List[String]. This time, 
when we add our int32s, they are converted to strings.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="SitStayCreate%20-%20Lists_files/Lists-Example2-Result.png"><br>
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 3</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="SitStayCreate%20-%20Lists_files/Lists-Example3.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                In example 3, we begin as we did in example 1 by 
creating a List[object] object and adding four elements with the .add() 
method.
                However, in this example, we use the .remove() method to
 remove elements from the list. The .remove() method will return true 
                if the element was in the list and remove the element 
from the list. It will return false if the element was not in the list.
                First we remove the fourth element, since it has the 
value 3, and return $true. Next we remove the third element since it has
 
                the value 2, and return $true. We call the remove 
.method() one more time and try to remove an element with the value 2. 
Since 
                the list no longer contains any elements with the value 
two, the method returns false and no elements are removed. We then write
 
                our list object to the console window.
            </p>
