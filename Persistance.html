                This is the first lesson in a series of lessons on how 
you can save data so you can use it later with PowerShell.             
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Before you begin: </h2>
            <p>
                In this lesson, we will be using PowerShell files you can find in the following github repo in a folder named 
                PowerShell_Peristance:
                <a href="https://github.com/PowerShellFieldGuide/Examples">https://github.com/PowerShellFieldGuide/Examples</a>.
                If you have never used Github before, for full instructions on how to download this file, please see my page on 
                <a href="./Getting_Started.html">Getting Started</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">The problem</h2>
            <p>
                When a script runs, a process is created and exists for 
the duration of that script. Any memory allocated to storing
                objects or other values disappears once the process 
stops. Sometimes, in order to automate something, you will need
                to store some data, possibly the last time a script ran 
or even the output from the script.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Persistance</h2>
            <p>
                In computer science, when data outlives the process that
 created it, it is called persistance. We are storing the state
                of the system (i.e. an object's properties) somewhere so
 that we can use it after our program is finished running.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Ways to save state</h2>
            <p>
                There are a number of different ways to achieve this. 
Plain text files are possibly the simplest way to store state.
                There are other data formats, such as xml, json, and 
csv, that while technically plain text files, have a more structured
                syntax for storing data than a simple .txt file. These 
data formats are both relatively human-readable, yet also encode
                data in a more machine-readable way when compared to 
.txt files.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to plain text files, you can also use 
databases. You probably are familiar with SQL and MySql databases and 
may
                even use one at work even if you are only an 
administrator. These databases, while powerful and secure, are probably 
not the
                best choices to use when writing scripts. If for some 
reason you do need to use a relational database for your scripts, Sqlite
                should be more than enough to meet your needs. This is a
 lightweight relational database management system written as a C
                library that is packaged as part of a program instead of
 being hosted on a server. The Windows Registry is also technically a
                database and you can use it to store state. While not as
 scary as it probably sounds, I would advise against doing this. The 
main
                benefit I can see to storing state this way would be 
that people who aren't in the administrators group hopefully won't be 
able
                to alter or destroy the data. There are probably always 
other better ways to do this using ACLs.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Get-Date</h2>
            <p>
                One of the first scripts I wrote that really 
differentiated me from my teammates as "the scripting guy" involved 
storing a
                timestamp of the last time the script ran. My boss 
thought it was magic and asked me a couple of times "how does it know 
what
                day it is?" The magic behind the script was that all 
computers have some representation of the current time and every 
programming
                language I've ever used has made that pretty easy to 
access. The only problems I had to solve were 1) how to format the date 
so it
                worked and 2) how to store it after the program was 
finished running.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this script, I was using Tcl on a legacy system, but
 fortunately for you we don't have to do that. PowerShell has a cmdlet 
named
                Get-Date which will return the current date time. There 
are some switches for formatting the date, but we don't want to format 
our data
                before we store it. We want to store the data in its 
original form and format it when we're using it later. 
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Get-Date</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Persistance_files/Get-Date.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                For the next three lessons, I am going to show you 
different ways to store the information returned from Get-Date so that 
you can
                use it later. I will be covering the strengths and 
weaknesses of each. I will also be including an example of how to use 
PowerShell
                to get the names of the members of the administrators 
group on a target machine and record that to an external file for later 
use.
                This script is useful for auditing computers in a small 
organization where things may not be locked down very tight.
