                In this lesson we are going to be diving into a topic we've tangentially discussed and that is
                Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Before you begin: </h2>
            <p>
                In this lesson, we will be using a file named PowerShellOOP.ps1. This is a PowerShell script that contains
                our example code. It is not required that you use this file to follow along, but I think it will be helpful.
                You can find this file in the following github repo in a folder named examples:
                <a href="https://github.com/PowerShellFieldGuide/Examples">https://github.com/PowerShellFieldGuide/Examples</a>.
                If you have never used Github before, for full instructions on how to download this file, please see my page on 
                <a href="./Getting_Started.html">Getting Started</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">What is Object-Oriented Programming?</h2>
            <p>
                I think one of the more difficult aspects of 
understanding OOP when I first was learning programming is I didn't 
fully 
                understand other programming paradigms so had nothing to
 contrast it against. There are many different programming
                paradigms, but the three you may have heard about are 
procedural, functional, and object-oriented. So far the examples
                we have covered have had more of a procedural approach. 
We've written some functions and used some objects, but we've
                mostly been concerned with executing commands in a 
linear fashion.
            </p>
            <p>
                OOP differs from other programming paradigms in that it 
uses objects that are representations of objects or things in 
                the real world. Also like objects in real life, objects 
in OOP have attributes and can do things. We call the attributes 
                "properties" and the actions the objects can do are 
called "methods."
            </p>
            <p>
                But where do these objects come from? Objects come from 
templates called classes. Classes describe how to make a particular 
                object, what properties it has, and what methods it has.
 The objects we have been working with so far have been come from 
                classes in the .Net framework.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 1: Defining a class in PowerShell</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Classes_files/PoshOOP-Class.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Above we have our full code for defining a class. First,
 on line 2 we begin with the class keyword and then the name
                of our class. We then enter into the code block which 
will contain our properties and methods. We inititialize our
                two string properties on lines 5 and 6. Here we place 
the datatype of our properties inside of square brackets before
                our variable names. Next, we have two methods for 
getting the property values as well as two methods for setting the
                property values. We call these methods getter and setter
 methods. These methods are very common in OOP and most classes
                you encounter in a language like Java have these. The 
purpose of these methods is to control access to setting and 
                retrieving property values, but they are less important 
in PowerShell since we do not have a way to truly restrict
                access to our properties (the "private" access modifier 
in other languages is not available here).
            </p>
            <p>
                You may have noticed a weird variable named $this. $this
 just refers to the current class. So when we look at the
                getter methods, we are returning whatever value is 
stored in the Breed property in the current class by referring to
                the current class with the $this variable.
            </p>

            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 2: Creating an object instance of a class in PowerShell</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Classes_files/PoshOOP-InstantiateObjects.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                I hope now you have an understanding of how to define a 
class in PowerShell, but now that we have a class defined, how do 
                we use it to create objects? There are actually two ways
 to create objects and we have seen both before when working with
                arrays and arraylists. The first way to create an object
 in PowerShell is with the New-Object cmdlet (line 31). The other
                way to instantiate objects is with the static new method
 we used as an alternative we to make arrays. Every .Net class
                has a static new constructor which can be used to create
 an instance of the class. In order to use it, we specify the name
                of the class in square brackets followed by two colons 
and the word new followed by a pair of parentheses.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to avoid discussing static methods in detail 
until next lesson so we can stay focused on how to create and use 
                classes here. I did want to mention the syntax for 
instantiating objects this way now so that you can become familiar
                with it. Once we have created our object instances and 
stored them in the variables $Wilfred and $Bubsy, we can then
                set the property values for their breeds (line 32 and 
line 39) and names (line 33 and line 40).
            </p>
            <p>
                We use our getter methods on lines 34, 35, 41, and 42 and return the following output to the console:
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Classes_files/PoshOOP-Result1.png"><br>
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 3: Class Constructors</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Classes_files/PoshOOP-Example2.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                There is one more concept I want to cover in this first 
lesson on classes and that is class constructors. What is a class
                constructor and why do we need it? Think back to our 
previous example. We created object instances on one line and later
                assigned values to their properties. It might seem like 
there may be a more concise way to do this where we can
                instantiate the object and assign values to the 
properties at the same time like we did when created variables and
                assigned values to them at the same time. Not only that,
 but if we had an object with many properties it would get
                pretty redundant creating them this way if we needed 
more than one instance for a script or program. Lastly, consider that
                there are some objects that we should never instantiate 
without any properties. Imagine in our last example with our
                Dog class that one of the properties was the dog's 
weight. It doesn't really ever make sense for us to instantiate a 
                weightless dog unless we are in space!
            </p>
            <p>
                We can solve all of these problems by defining a class 
constructor in the class definition. A class constructor is
                used to tell PowerShell how to construct the class. All 
classes in PowerShell have a class constructor, but if we don't
                define one ourselves, PowerShell will assume we want to 
use a default constructor where we just create the class and do
                not set any properties. See below for the syntax for a 
class constructor.
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Classes_files/PoshOOP-Example2Constructor.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                You may notice that the class constructor has the same 
name as the class itself, followed by two parantheses for input
                parameters, followed by a block of code where we set the
 value of the class's properties to the values input as
                parameters. It is a convention I learned from Java to 
keep these names the same and since C# is similar, I follow this
                pattern, but it is not a requirement to have the 
parameters be named the same as the properties. It would be confusing
                to me if someone didn't do that, but technically the 
syntax will work. It is also possible to have a class constructor
                without any input parameters. We could have default 
values we always set the properties to without inputting them ourselves.
                See below for the output of this example.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Classes_files/PoshOOP-Result2.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                There's a lot more to cover about OOP and classes in 
PowerShell beyond what I have covered here. I am going to be
                creating more lessons around the topic and demonstrating
 some techniques that can get you started creating your
                own classes in PowerShell for your projects. If there is
 anything I want an IT admin with no programming knowledge
                to take away from this, it is to be thinking of 
PowerShell more in terms of objects than a stream of codata as you
                would in other shells.
