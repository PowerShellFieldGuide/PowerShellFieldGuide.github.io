            <p>
                The following lessons will at times refer to PowerShell script examples. I have created completed and tested
                code that is designed to help you as you learn. It is not required that you download these examples - I think
                it will be possible to learn by just reading along. I think there is a certain level of confidence that comes
                from reading about something then actually trying it yourself to see if you can get it to work. Over time, this
                has been what has allowed me to dream bigger.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">Github Repository </h2>
            <p>
                These files are hosted in a github repo. You may find them here: 
                <a href="https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell">https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell</a>.
                First, navigate to that link, then click code, and then click Download Zip
                </p><div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                    <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Getting%20Started_files/repo.png"><br>
                </div>
                Now, extract the files from the zip. Place the folder somewhere that is convenient for you to access. I think
                placing it inside your Documents folder is a reasonable place. Some administrators like to create a directory
                named scripts in their C:\ drives to hold their scripts. I think that's okay for production scripts, but
                I think will be a bit of a PITA for our purposes here.
            <p></p>
            <p>
                Since I have mentioned Github I want to say that I am a fan of git and use it for version control when
                writing scripts. I recommend taking the time to learn git, especially if you're an administrator who is
                comfortable with the commandline. I think you will find it is incredibly useful and easy to pick up, at
                least as far as the basics are concerned.
