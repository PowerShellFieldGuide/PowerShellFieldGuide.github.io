			<h2 class="text-center my-4">PowerShell - What is it?</h2>
			<p>
				PowerShell is at its core a toolbox filled with everything you will need as
				a Windows power user. It provides ways to check system log files, navigate
				the file system, change file permissions, create, read, and modify files,
				create, read, and modify registry entries, check system information,
				create, disable, and delete new users/user groups just to name a few things
				it can do right out of the box.
			</p>
			<p>
				To say it is a toolbox is to say it is not just a tool, but a container for
				a number of different tools. At a macro level, it is a scripting language
				and a shell language. This dual nature of PowerShell can lead to complexity
				at times and in some cases, seemingly bad designs. Often when I see something
				that makes me wonder why someone would ever want to use a particular syntax
				I often have to shift my perspective from using the shell to scripting or
				vice versa.
			</p>
			<p>
				Beyond this it is also a toolbox made up of many small tools like you have
				in other shell languages and scripting languages. There is the .Net framework
				and it's classes, there are the CIM and WMI models, there are PowerShell cmdlets,
				and there are operators, control flow statements, and other language constructs
				you might encounter in a scripting language.
			</p>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-8">
					<p>
						First open PowerShell. The best way is to use the windows key + x to get the windows
						power user menu. Now press i to open a PowerShell console as a regular user or
						you can press x to open a PowerShell console as an administrator. You should only
						use PowerShell as an administrator when you need to and be careful when you
						are using it as an administrator. I am not responsible if you break your operating
						system and I am not obligated to help you fix it if you do something reckless.
						If you only use windows as a regular user it will make it much harder to do something
						you will regret later. Not only this, but it is a good security practice to not use
						an administrator account for regular day-to-day computer use. You should have two accounts
						- one in the administrators group and one that is a regular user.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now that you have the console open, copy and paste the following in your shell console window: Write-Host "Hello World";<br>
						The syntax for this shell command can be broken into two parts. The first part is the cmdlet
						and the second part is the argument. The cmdlet here is Write-Host. The argument is "Hello World;"
						Cmdlets are similar to shell commands in other shell languages. They use a consistent style which is 
						Verb-Noun. Not only this, but PowerShell provides a list of approved verbs for its cmdlets. Once 
						you are familiar with a few different cmdlets you will be able to get a sense of what a cmdlet does
						just by reading its name. PowerShell's stylization is one of its benefits when compared to 
						other shell languages. By following a consistent pattern, PowerShell makes it easy to find new 
						cmdlets or cmdlets with similar functions.

				</div>
			</div>
			<h2 class="text-center my-4">PowerShell - Scripts</h2>
			<p>
				We can create a file with a .ps1 extension and place PowerShell code inside of it to create
				a script. Let's take our Write-Host cmdlet from before and place it inside of a file named
				HelloWorld.ps1. Since this is a PowerShell tutorial, let's do these steps with PowerShell.
			</p>
			<div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
				<img class="border img-fluid" src="./Basics_files/CreatePS1File.png"><br>
			</div>
			<p>
				If you want to, you can just copy the above commands yourself into your console. I am going to briefly
				run through what everything is doing here so that you know exactly what you are doing to your
				machine each step of the way. It is a good idea to fully understand what the consequences of a change
				to your machine will be before making it. As a rule, I never run any shell commands I do not understand
				unless it is a test machine that I created specifically for that purpose.
			</p>
			<p>
				First we have Set-Location with an argument of Documents. I am starting in the Public users directory
				so have Documents as a child directory. Set-Location is PowerShell's version of cd and, in fact, when
				you use cd in PowerShell, you are actually using an alias for Set-Location. Set-Location takes the path
				to a directory as an argument, in this case "Documents." I normally will use the aliases for Set-Location
				unless I am writing a script. In general, I use aliases for convenience in the shell and the full cmdlet
				names when writing scripts for clarity. One really cool thing about Set-Location is you can use UNC	paths 
				in addition to mapped drives. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Next we have New-Item. New-Item is a swiss-army knife cmdlet for creating, well, new items. It can handle
				directories, files, and even registry items. Here we specify the itemtype to be a directory and the name
				of the directory to be "PowerShell." If you run this cmdlet, it will create a new directory for you. If
				you do not want that to happen, do not run this cmdlet.
			</p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col">
					<p>
						We then Set-Location to that new Directory one more time. Pro-Tip: the tab key will autocomplete words
						in the shell. If you type the letter P and hit tab, it will find this directory for you.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now we type notepad.exe followed by the name of the file we wish to create. Notepad will try to open
						this file and if it does not exit will show the following dialog box:
					</p>

				<div class="col">
					<div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
						<img class="border img-fluid" src="./Basics_files/Dialogue.png"><br>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				Now paste Write-Host "Hello World"; in the file, save it and close notepad.exe
			</p>
			<div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
				<img class="border img-fluid" src="./Basics_files/Script.png"><br>
			</div>
			<p>
				To run the script you just created, enter the path to the script. You can use relative paths here with .\
				representing the current directory and ..\ representing the parent directory. This should be familiar
				to *nix and Windows administrators, but I wanted to include it for anyone coming from a development background.
			</p>
			<div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
				<img class="border img-fluid" src="./Basics_files/RunScript.png"><br>
			</div>
			<p>
				In the above example, we used notepad.exe to create our PowerShell script. While this is a fully 
				acceptable way to write PowerShell scripts, there are better options than using notepad.exe to create 
				your scripts. Windows 10 includes an application called the PowerShell ISE or integrated scripting
				environment. This application is similar to IDEs or integrated development environments
				used by programmers in other languages. It offers features such as intelligent code
				completion, debugging tools, and a way to search for cmdlets as well as a GUI to help
				get the syntax correct. While this utility is nice, I prefer to us Visual Studio Code.
				This is a free text-editor style application like notepad+ or sublime text, but with
				plugins is a really nice environment for developing PowerShell scripts. Really, you can use
				whatever you want, even vim if it floats your boat. One of the reasons I like VS Code
				is because it lends itself well to scripting and web development, so I can do everything I
				need to in that IDE. When I am on a linux environment, I normally will use Sublime text
				for my IDE. Outside of writing these lessons, I would never write PowerShell scripts on
				a Linux machine.

			</div>
			<h2 class="text-center my-4">PowerShell - Execution Policy</h2>
			<p>
				We can't really talk about PowerShell scripts without talking about running scripts and
				specifically, why you won't be able to run scripts on a Windows 10 machine right out of the
				box unless you create them on your own machine.
			</p>
			<p>
				PowerShell has something called the Execution Policy which controls whether or not you
				are able to run scripts on a machine. On a Windows 10 client, the default for this will
				be restricted. This will allow you to run scripts you have written on your own machine,
				but will not allow you to run scripts written on other machines. There are a few settings for this,
				but it's one of the areas I think Microsoft's documentation is both thorough and easy to understand,
				so I am not going to cover it in detail here. I do want to mention that the setting "Bypass" will
				allow you to run scripts written by anyone on any machine. It's not a good idea to leave your
				execution policy bypassed on your computer all of the time. There are better ways to manage
				the execution policy and even ways to temporarily bypass it for the duration of a script.
				For detailed information on Execution Policy settings, you can check Microsoft's documentation: 
				<a href=""></a>
			</p>
			<div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
				<img class="border img-fluid" src="./Basics_files/ExecutionPolicy.png"><br>
			</div>
			<p>
				The way to manage your execution policy is with the Get-ExecutionPolicy and Set-ExecutionPolicy
				cmdlets. You are able to check your execution policy setting with Get-ExecutionPolicy and change
				it with Set-ExecutionPolicy. You can check what it is set to as a normal user, but depending on the argument 
				you provide the scope parameter, you may or may not need administrator permissions to change it. You are going to need to 
				bypass it to follow along with my examples, but should set it to "Default" when you are done running my script examples.
				One way to be safe about this is to limit the change to the scope of the process. This will only apply to your current
				PowerShell session or PowerShell sessions created as child processes of your current PowerShell session.
