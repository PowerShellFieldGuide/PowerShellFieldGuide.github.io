            <p>
                What is an Array? An array is a data structure that is a
 collection of elements. Each element is identified by an index.
                Arrays may be called by different names in different 
languages. They are similar to the list data structure in Python.
                Arrays in PowerShell have a fixed length and are 
mutable. More on this later. In PowerShell, the Array data type is
                represented as &lt;data type&gt;[], for instance 
string[] or int[] for string arrays and integer arrays.
            </p>
            <p> 
                This definition is a bit abstract though. I'm going to 
try to use a somewhat original simile here and say an array is
                like a a PO box. If you have ever had a PO Box you know 
that it is composed of one or more rows and one or more columns
                of numbered metal boxes with doors on them. If you have 
never had a PO Box (are they called something different 
                internationally?) I have conveniently provided a picture
 for you.

                When you rent a PO Box, you are given the number of a 
box and a key with the number to access the box. You use the
                number of the PO Box to find it and retrieve your mail. 
The post office employees also use the box number to fill
                your box with mail.

            <p> 
                This is much like how an array works in PowerShell. You 
can think of an array as having numbered boxes where you
                can store values. The way you access or change the data 
in the boxes is by using the numbers associated with the box.
                We call these "boxes" elements and there are numbered 
with the first element starting with 0. You will find that this
                is how most programming languages handle numbering and 
it is zero-based numbering. Here is a fun paper arguing why
                zero-based numbering is best from Dr. Edsger W Dykstra 
written in 1982: 
                <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd08xx/EWD831.PDF">https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd08xx/EWD831.PDF</a>

            </p>
            <p> 
                Let's go back to our original definition. I mentioned 
that arrays in PowerShell are of a fixed size. Think about the PO
                boxes again. They're constructed out of metal and fitted
 into the wall. It would be possible to add more if we needed to,
                but it would be pretty involved. We might even have to 
build an additional wing on the building for more room. It definitely
                would be an involved and dare-I-say resource intensive 
process. We now have covered the strength and weakness of an array -
                it is very quick to look up the value of an element or 
change the value of an element, but it is very slow and resource
                intensive to insert or add elements to an array, since 
it involves creating a new array and copying the old values to the 
                new cells.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 1</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Arrays_files/Arrays-Example1.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                In the first example we see what is probably the 
simplest syntax in PowerShell for creating an array. Here on line 1 we 
                initialize a variable named $BreakfastArray that is 
three elements long and contains three strings: "Spam", "Eggs", "Bacon".
                We are able to do this in PowerShell by just seperating 
these strings by commas. This is not the most common syntax that you
                will encounter for initializing arrays in PowerShell and
 I would discourage using it. It works, but it is slightly more 
ambiguous
                than the other ways of creating arrays.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next on line 3, we call the getType() method on the 
$BreakfastArray to display it's type. In the output, we can see that the
 BaseType
                is System.Array. This is the .Net namespace the array 
object lives in. The type accelerator (remember those guys?) for an 
object array
                in PowerShell is [object[]]. This type of array will 
store objects in its elements, so can store different types, such as 
strings or
                int32s. There are also other array types, such as 
[string[]] or [int[]] which will only accomodate element values that are
 strings or 
                int32s, respectively. This is a feature of OOP called 
polymorphism. I don't want to dive too deep into that right now, but 
thought it 
                was important to mention.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next lines display the output to the console. Line 5
 just creates a blank line. Next we have a line that displays the total 
number
                of elements the array contains. We get this number by 
calling the .count method on our array. On line 7, PowerShell writes 
"Element 0 
                is: " and the value of the first element to the console.
 PowerShell repeats this on lines 8 and 9 for the next elements. On line
 10, 
                PowerShell writes the text "Displaying the whole array 
looks like this: " and then writes the contents of the array to the 
console.

            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">

            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 2</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Arrays_files/Arrays-Example2.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                In example 2, we encounter what is probably the most 
common syntax for creating arrays in PowerShell. Here we use what is 
called 
                the array sub-expresion operator in PowerShell. We begin
 with the commercial at sign followed by parentheses. The array 
sub-expression 
                operator will take the statement inside of the 
parentheses and place it inside of an array.
            </p>
            <p>
                This operator is great - what it means is unambiguous and you can even use it to create arrays of 0 length.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Arrays_files/Arrays-Example2-Result.png"><br>
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 3</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Arrays_files/Arrays-Example3.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Here we see yet another way to create arrays, which is 
quite useful when working with For loops. This syntax is less common 
than
                the array sub-expression operator, but is something you 
will definitely want to know about. Line 1 might look a little bit weird
 
                at first, but consider that everything to the left of 
the equal sign is something you definitely understand. Following that, 
things 
                start to look a little bit hairier, but we know that 
[object[]] is just the type accelerator for an array object from example
 1.
                That just leaves ::new(3). I told you that PowerShell 
uses the .Net framework for it's base types before. Well, Arrays are one
 of 
                PowerShell's base types, so therefore comes from the 
.Net framework. All .Net framework classes have a static method named 
new() 
                by default. When we get to the lesson on classes, I will
 go into more detail on what a static method is, but for now you can 
think 
                of the new() method as a built-in way to create an 
object of that type. The number we provide the new method is the length 
we want 
                our array to be when it is created. We pass in the 
number 3, so get an array with 3 elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following this we assign string values to our elements 
using the same syntax we used to access our element values before 
followed by 
                the equals assignment operator and the value to be 
assigned. We then display the results as we have before.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Arrays_files/Arrays-Example3-Result.png"><br>
            </div>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Example 4</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Arrays_files/Arrays-MultiDimensional.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                I don't think you're going to use multidimensional 
arrays in PowerShell. The only reason I have this example here is 
because you 
                cannot create a multidimensional array using nested 
array sub-expression operators. You have to use the static new method on
 an 
                object of type [object[,]] NOT type [object[]]. Notice 
that you set the length by providing two values seperated by a common in
 
                the new method.
            </p>
            <p>
                I really don't recommend using this in your code unless 
it's really going to be worth it. It's not so much that multidimensional
 
                arrays aren't useful, it's more that they are so 
uncommon to encounter you might confuse a lot of people when they first 
see it. 
                I always try as best as I can to stick to conventions 
and use the most commonly used features when I write my scripts because I
 
                assume at some point someone else is going to have to 
understand mt code.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Output:</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">

            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./Arrays_files/Arrays-For.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                In this example, I have a for loop that will iterate 
over the items in an array. Iterating over the items in an collection is
 something you 
                will need to do so often (this is pretty much the point 
of collections) that PowerShell has a special construct for just this 
purpose. We 
                will be looking at this in the next lesson on Foreach 
loops.
