            <p>
                In this lesson, we will be using PowerShell files you can find in the following github repo in a folder named 
                PowerShell_Control_Flow:
                <a href="https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell">https://github.com/ScottVaiskauckas/PowerShell</a>.
                If you have never used Github before, for full instructions on how to download this file, please see my page on 
                <a href="./Getting_Started.html">Getting Started</a>.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-center my-4">While loops</h2>
            <p>
                While loops work a bit like if statements, but when we 
reach the end of the code block, instead of exiting the statement,
                we go back to the beginning and test the condition 
again. We repeate this until the condition is $True.
                <!-- TODO: Read other definitions and work on this part -->
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">While Example 1</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./While_files/While-Example1.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                In the first example, we begin by initializing a 
variable named $RunCount with a value of 1. Next we have our While 
statement
                on line 3. Following the While keyword, we have our test
 condition which evaluates to true. Since the condition is true, the 
                code block executes. PowerShell writes the string "The 
while loop has run 1 times" to the console. It then increments the value
 
                of $RunCount to 2. PowerShell reaches the end of the 
code block and moves back to the test condition. 2 is still less than or
 
                equal to 3, so the test condition is still true. The 
code block executes once again writing "The while loops has run 2 times"
                to the console window and incrementing the $RunCount 
variable. PowerShell hits the end of the code block and moves back to 
the 
                test condition. 3 is still less than or equal to 3 so 
the test condition is true. The code block executes one more time 
writing 
                "The while loop has run 3 times" before incrementing the
 $RunCount variable again. Now PowerShell returns to the test condition 
                again. This time, since $RunCount is 4, the condition 
fails and the While loop exits.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Using break statements in while loops</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./While_files/While-Break.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                We saw in the last lesson on Switch statements that the 
break statement can be used to break out of a control block. 
                It can also be used to break out of while loops. 
Consider the code example above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here we have an example that is almost identical to our 
first example, with on exception; there is an if statement following 
                the line where we increment our variable. This if 
statement tests to see if $RunCount is equal to 2. If it is, PowerShell 
will 
                write "We're breaking out of the loop" and then exit the
 While loop. We can run the code and see this is in fact what happens.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Infinite loops</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./While_files/While-InfiniteLoop.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Sometimes, it is possible to have a bug in your code 
where the test condition will always be true. Consider the above 
example. 
                We have made a mistake here where we are decrementing 
$RunCount instead of incrementing, but still testing whether or not 
                $RunCount is less than or equal 3. Since $RunCount 
begins as 1, we never fulfill the test condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this case, the loop 
                will never exit and so is called an "infinite loop." If 
you create this situation on your own machine, you can exit the loop 
                by pressing ctrl+c.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Do-While Example1</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./While_files/Do-While-Example1.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Consider that in some cases, it may be useful to execute
 a code block before evaluating whether or not a given condition is
                true, then after it has run once, evaluate that 
condition and repeat the code if it is true. PowerShell provides us with
 Do-While
                statements to do just this.
            </p>
            <p>
                This code looks very similar to our While examples, 
however instead of a While statement, on line 3, we have the beginning 
of a 
                do-while statement. The code following Do executes the 
first time no matter what. We then reach our test condition following 
the 
                While keyword where we check to see if $RunCount is less
 than or equal to 3. It is equal to 2 now, so we execute the code block 
                following the Do keyword once more. We reach our test 
condition and since $RunCount is 3 and 3 is less than or equal to 3, we 
                execute the code block following the Do keyword once 
again.
            </p>
            <h5 class="text-center my-4">Do-Until Example1</h5>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center container-fluid my-3">
                <img class="border img-fluid" src="./While_files/Do-Until-Example1.png"><br>
            </div>
            <p>
                Do-Until works similarly to Do-While, except it executes
 UNTIL a condition is true, instead of WHILE it is true. Another way 
                of stating that is Do-Until will execute WHILE a 
condition is false. The above example will produce identical results to 
the 
                code in the Do-While example.
            </p>
